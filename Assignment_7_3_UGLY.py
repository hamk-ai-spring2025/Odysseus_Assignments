# Prompt Create an interpreter program with Python code. The program records a user's voice. Recorded voice should be transcribed as a text output. Then the transcribed text into another language which is selected by the user. Available languages should be English, French and Finnish. User should be asked which language the user wants to text to be translated. Translated text should be able to speak out load. There should be also a calculation which calculates how many seconds translation from the original speech to user's selected language takes.
